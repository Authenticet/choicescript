You don't remember much about your parents.  You know your mother died in childbirth and your father was killed when you were just three years old.  After your father had died, you lived the next 13 years of your life with your three older brothers, who'd taken care of you ever since.  You'd enjoyed your life with them, helping with the family's small lumber mill.  Income was steady since you'd lived your life at the base of a mountain in the middle of nowhere.  The two closest settlements being the large, corrupted town of Cuostin, and the peaceful but sleepy village of Phaanridge.  However, your lumber mill was the only lumber mill for miles around, so you and your brothers provided wood for both settlements.
